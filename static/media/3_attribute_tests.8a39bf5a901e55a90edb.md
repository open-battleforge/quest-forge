# Attributes and Tests

Character attributes can be used in a variety of ways to influence the world. Rolling to see if a character can complete an action
is called an attribute test. 

## Attribute Test

To take an attribute test, roll a D20 and your **modifier dice** as well as any additional bonuses (from perks or equipment) to the test result.
If your roll equals or exceeds the test, it is passed. If the result is less than the required value, the test is failed and the game continues on.
