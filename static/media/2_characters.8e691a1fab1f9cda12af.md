# Character Creation

Characters in Quest Forge can be created in a multitude of ways and are not bound to any particular equipment selection
in order to allow for maximum customization. Characters will usually start a first level, with a small selection
of attribute points to assign and a number of perk points to purchase special abilities.

## The Concept

The beginning of any great RPG character is a concept. Imagine the sort of role you'd like to take in your adventuring party
and choose the race, class and perks that best allow you to carry out that role. There's nothing wrong with having
multiple characters with the same class and race as they can choose wildly different equipment and abilities to serve
a different niche in the group.

**Name** - Choose an appropriate name for your character that fits into the world you and your GM have decided to enjoy.

**Description** - You will want to have some character appearance in mind when creating your character.
This will cover both your character's size, shape and other physical attributes that would allow other people to recognize 
them and how they might interact with the world.

**Background** - Choose a background for your character. This can include your character's place of birth, where they 
grew up and and additional details to explain how they became who they are.

## Choose Attributes
Character attributes determine how good at any particular skill your character will be. The higher the attribute, the better.

## Choose Perks

Character abilities provide unique and interesting actions that your character can do such as healing allies, summoning creatures
or even charming enemies.
